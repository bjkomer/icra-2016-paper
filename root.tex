\section{BACKGROUND}

\subsection{Quadcopter Dynamics}



\subsection{Adaptive Control}

Often the kinematics and dynamics of the system being controlled are unknown, or change over time in an unknown fashion. 
A controller that works well for the system initially may no longer be ideal when the system undergoes changes. 
In this situation, it is useful to have a controller that can adapt to these changes.

\section{CONCLUSIONS}


\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
